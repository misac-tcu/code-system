    <h2>The Code System for FHIR Structured Report</h2>
    <p>With amount of code systems, libraries and value sets that are already available. However, there is still no
        international standard code used in medical finding observation, both in mammography, chest x-ray and others.
        In addition, there are difficulties in mapping code values used in the finding form to LOINC or SNOMED code
        system. Therefore HL7 establishes an independent value set in breast radiology, but it will lead to different
        body locations and organs have each own value set, this causes difficulty managing the current system code.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, a new standardize of code value based on medical anatomy and pathology is created in this
        specification to facilitate the easy reading and effective definition of code. Moreover, a new standardize of
        code value obtain the code that can be used for all body sites, it will simplify the use of independent value
        sets at each body site.</p>
    <p>
        The advantages of the new standardize of code value:<br>
        &#9826 Mnemonic code will be more convenience for communication and easy to understand.<br>
        &#9826 May be used for training AI systems in professional speech recognition in the future<br>
        &#9826 New code system use clear name to define the code value <br>
    </p>
    <p>Example:
        In current situation there are three different code systems used to define the location code value of liver,
        breast and colon.<br>
        &#9826 Breast: <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/us/breastcancer/2018May/CodeSystem-oncology-BreastSiteCS.html"
            target="blank">http://hl7.org/fhir/us/breastcancer/2018May/CodeSystem-oncology-BreastSiteCS.html</a><br>
        &#9826 Liver:<a href="https://www.radelement.org/home/elements/element/RDE1053"
            target="blank">https://www.radelement.org/home/elements/element/RDE1053</a><br>
        &#9826 Colon: <a href="https://www.radelement.org/home/elements/element/RDE79"
            target="blank">https://www.radelement.org/home/elements/element/RDE79</a><br>
        But for the present it will develop an independent location code system to collect all location value codes used
        in all body organ (both liver, innestine, and breast radiography, etc), bellow is the Location Code System web
